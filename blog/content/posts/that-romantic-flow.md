<pre>
Life is beautiful
I feel it inside
But how can I express
The inner mind?
I suppose I can try
Let’s take a ride…

Heart overflowing
No need to hide
Love is a real thing
And there’s a spiritual side.

There is magic
Hidden from our eyes
Yet felt with the soul
That romantic flow.

And to this goal
I continue to stroll
Seeking that beacon
My spirit to strengthen.
