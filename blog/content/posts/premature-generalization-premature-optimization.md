title: Premature generalization is the new premature optimization
category: programming

A [co-worker](http://www.wisdomandwonder.com/) was just showing me a situation where another developer had written a validation framework which was only used on 2 pages.  I've seen this pattern again and again, and I've put a phrase to the thought:

    Premature generalization is the new premature optimization.

And it, too, is evil.
