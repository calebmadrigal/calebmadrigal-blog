<pre>
Oft on cold and starry nights,
He raises arms, and the battle fights.
And storms the castle of my mind
Removing from the throne my logical side.

And having the ship commandeered,
Into the stormy winds he steers
And brings us into crashing waves -
Deep oceans are within his gaze.

And rejoicing on the captain's deck
Tiring of appointments to respect
He does not care if we should wreck
But only in beauty does he invest.

Careless and wild - this side of mine.
Roaring through life, not glancing behind
"Behold! the sails are filled with wind!
Onward towards the moon again!"
