"We all must die."
"That's beautiful!", she cried.

But for now I will hold you in my embrace
Though fleeting be this time and place.

Fear not my love, there is more!
Just wait till we reach that other shore.

Beauty will become us - you and I,
And "together we will live forever" in the sky.

* Inspiration: Clint Mansell's *"Together We Will Live Forever"*, Darren Aronofsky's *"The Fountain"*, The Flaming Lips' *"Do You Realize?"*. Every person you know will die. So let's not waste our life - let's live to the fullest, and hope for what is to come.
