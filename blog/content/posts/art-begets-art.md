Art begets art
Hate begets hate
Love begets love
Grace begets grace.

Before we depart
We do place
A lasting mark
On others' fate.

* Inspiration: I've found that taking in good art makes me want to write.
* Note: This isn't so much a poem as a truth put into a rhythmic format. It's a bit too "teachy" to be real poetry, in my opinion. Real poetry should not try to teach directly, but rather, should convey feelings (which may indirectly teach something).
