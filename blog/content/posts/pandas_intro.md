I've recently been playing with the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) Python data analysis framework while reading the [Python for Data Analysis book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) (which is written by the author of the pandas library).  Here are 2 of my iPython Notebooks that demonstrate some of the basics:

  * [US Names Examples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/calebmadrigal/ipython_notebooks/master/PandasBabyNameAnalysis.ipynb)


	
    * This is an example from the book which I've made some modifications to.







And here's a little screenshot of what it looks like in iPython Notebook:
