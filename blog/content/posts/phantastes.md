        And rippling rivulet, and evening gloom,

        Held commune with him; as if he and it
        Were all that was."

And here is an excerpt from the middle of the book:

        Then the woman spoke, but without lifting her head or looking at me: "You had better not open that door." This was uttered quite quietly; and she went on with her reading, partly in silence, partly aloud; but both modes seemed equally intended for herself alone. The prohibition, however, only increased my desire to see...
