<pre>
Ever feel that feeling 
That words cannot express?
Can't play my music loud enough
To this one coalesce.

I cannot run fast enough
Or flee it on my bike.
And if I shout at the top of my lungs
I'm still not satisfied.

This craving is for more
Than I can ever tell.
But if you feel what it is I feel,
Then you know what within me dwells.
