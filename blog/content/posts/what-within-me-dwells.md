<pre>
Ever feel that feeling 
That words cannot express?
Can't play my music loud enough
To this one coalesce.

I cannot run fast enough
Or flee it on my bike.
And if I scream my lungs out
I'm still not satisfied.

This craving is for more
Than I can ever tell.
But if you feel this feeling
You know what within me dwells.
