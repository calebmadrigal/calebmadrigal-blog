In the last week or so (starting Monday, March 3, 2014) I've been in a very poetic mood. It has been so interesting - it was light a light switch flipping on. I haven't been sitting down and trying to write poetry, they've just been coming to me. Often, as soon as one ends, another begins. It has been so pleasurable. I hope people enjoy them, but even if they don't, it has been so worth it to me!
