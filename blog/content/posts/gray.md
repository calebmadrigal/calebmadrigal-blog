Gray
I feel gray
Cannot stay
In this daze.

Even pain - 
Let it rain!
Anything… 
but this haze.

I need light
Or even night.
These gray skies
Glaze my eyes.

Stimulation!
Exhumation! 
Must awaken
To elation.

* Inspiration: I was in a gray mood today, and when I looked outside and saw the gray skies, I thought, “the weather matches my mood… or does my mood match the weather?” I didn’t feel like staying in this gray mood.
