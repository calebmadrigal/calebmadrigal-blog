Greetings fellow human! I'm Caleb (as you already know).

### Professionally

I'm a Software Consultant in Milwaukee, WI. My most recent development has been in: Python, Flask, Django, Javascript, Node.js, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Objective-C, Java, and C#/.NET.

Programming started off as a hobby for me (back in junior high), and naturally transformed into a career. I love it! I still enjoy doing interesting side projects; my most recent was a home security and automation system built in Python/Flask/jQuery mobile on the Raspberry Pi.

I also occasionally speak at software conferences like [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28946) and [Barcamp](https://barcampmilwaukee.org/).

### Personally

I am first a believer in something more than meets the eye. I believe that the beauty we see and feel around us points to a transcendental spiritual nature. I believe that love is more than a feeling (pun intended). I am a romantic, a spiritualist, and a Christian.

Iâ€™ve been trying to convey some of these feelings recently through [poetry](http://calebmadrigal.com/topics/poetry).

I am a husband and father. I love playing ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and occasionally, snowboarding.
