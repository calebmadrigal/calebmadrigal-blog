### Professionally

I'm a Security Software Engineer based out of Milwaukee, WI. My most recent development has been in: Python, C, Javascript/Node.js/Lodash.

On the side, I've been hacking around with [Software-Defined Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things) stuff recently.

I also occasionally speak at software conferences like [OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28946), [Cyphercon](http://cyphercon.com/), and [Barcamp](https://barcampmilwaukee.org/).

### Personally

I am first a believer in something more than meets the eye. I believe that the beauty we see and feel around us points to a transcendental spiritual nature. I believe that love is more than a feeling (pun intended). I am a romantic, a spiritualist, and a Christian.

Iâ€™ve been trying to convey some of these feelings recently through [poetry](http://calebmadrigal.com/topics/poetry).

I am a husband and father. I love playing ultimate frisbee, rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and occasionally, snowboarding.
