Since this blog is mostly software-focused, I'll focus on software first. I've been writing software for over 20 years. I specialize in math-intensive software, such as [machine learning/AI](https://madconsulting.ai), [radio hacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhuhJ9Oe9vA), and [doing art with math](https://gods.art).

I've spoken at a good number of hacker conferences, such as: [DEF CON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhuhJ9Oe9vA), [Thotcon](https://www.thotcon.org/), [Cyphercon](https://cyphercon.com/), [Deep Sec](https://deepsec.net/), and [OSCON](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/oscon.html).

My brother and I run a consulting company called [Mad Consuting](https://madconsulting.ai). We specialize in: 

* **1)** helping companies use machine learning
* **2)** mobile apps - we wrote our own app platform which we've used to launch a couple apps
* **3)** custom software - with a focus on math-intensive and cybersecurity-related applications.

Feel free to reach out if you've got a project you think we could help on.

One of the things I do for fun is algorithmic art - it's basically like acrylic pour paintings, except with equations and algorithms instead of paint. My art website is <https://gods.art>.

I believe in the God of Love. I believe in asking hard questions and pursuing the answers fearlessly. I am. <3
